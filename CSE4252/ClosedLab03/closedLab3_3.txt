Initial variable values: 
int v = 5 int x = 10

The memory location of v before the call is: 0x7ffe23877280
The memory location of x before the call is: 0x7ffe23877284
These memory addresses are passed as parameters to p_swap().

Inside p_swap, the memory addresses passed in as parameters are used to dereference v and x in order to perform the swap
 Inside the function. value of *v: 5 value of *x:  10
Values after swapping using p_swap(&v,&x): 
value of v= 10 value of x= 5

After the first swap, the memory location of v is: 0x7ffe23877280
After the first swap, the memory location of x is: 0x7ffe23877284
Initial variable values: 
int v = 5 int x = 10
These values are passed in as parameters to r_swap directly.

Inside r_swap, references to v and x are obtained using the address_of operator (&)
Inside the second function before the swap, the memory location of v is: 0x7ffe23877280
Inside the second function before the swap, the memory location of x is: 0x7ffe23877284
Inside second function. value of &v: 0x7ffe23877280 value of &x: 0x7ffe23877284
Values after swapping using r_swap(v,x): 
value of v= 10 value of x= 5
After the second swap, the memory location of v is: 0x7ffe23877280
After the second swap, the memory location of x is: 0x7ffe23877284
