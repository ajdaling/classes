Bessel Analysis

# Regions: (looking at the log-log plot)
# 1. x = [1:10] 
# 	This region shows a linear slope of -19.12, or a trend of x^-20. Here, we are seeing, 
#		for both recursive directions, a linear decrease in error until x=l (at x = 10), where the
# 	relative error is limited by the machine precision.
#
# 2. x = [1:35] 
#		This region is roughly flat and the relative error corresponds to the machine
#		precision for double's, ~10e-16.
#
#	3. x [35:50]
#		This region shows a linear slope of ~68, (x^68) power law, which is a very steep increase
# 	in the relative error. This is due to the fact that, looking at the bessel.ps plot, the
#		downward recursion method exhibits asymptotic behavior while the upward recursion method
#		is smooth. These deviations result in significant relative error (around unity).

GSL Bessel Analysis
#	The relative difference between the GSL bessel function and the downard recursion method
#	exhibits the same behavior as between upward and downward recursion above x=35; however, 
# between x = 0 and x = 35, the relative error is consistently at the machine precision of 
# 10e-16, implying that the two functions give nearly identical results.
